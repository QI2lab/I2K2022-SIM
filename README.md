# I2K2022-SIM
I2K 2022 multicolor 2D-SIM tutorial.

## Conda environments
We would like to ask attendees of the workshop to setup conda on their computers before the session. If you have never used conda before, please [read this guide first](https://biapol.github.io/blog/johannes_mueller/anaconda_getting_started/).

## Install mcSIM package
Create a new conda environment.
```
conda create -n mcsimi2k python=3.9
```
Activate the new conda environment.
```
conda activate mcsimi2k
```

Install mcSIM package, Napari, and other required tutorial packages via pip (roughly 5-10 minutes install).
```
pip install "git+https://git@github.com/qi2lab/mcSIM@master#egg=mcSIM" "napari[all]" "nd2" "ipykernel" "ipympl" "napari-plot-profile"
````

## Download the reconstruction examples in this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/QI2lab/I2K2022-SIM.git
```

If you don't have git installed, you can download this repository using the green code button above and unzip on your computer.
